## Install

You will need `figlet`(found in most OS repos) installed.

If you want the clock to be multicolored then you will need `lolcat` to be installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/j0shua-daniel/fclock
cd fclock
chmod +x fclock
sudo mv fclock /usr/bin/
```

## Usage

Just run `fclock` to get the default clock.

Run `fclock | lolcat` to get the multicolored clock.
